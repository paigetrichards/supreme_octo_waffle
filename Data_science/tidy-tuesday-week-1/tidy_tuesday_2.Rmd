Although this plot has a **ton** of code that is unnecessary and able to be distilled down, it was extremely helpful to write it this way. I tried to use gganimate, but I found that it may not be a useful technique for this type of information. I had a graph that was slightly animated but it looked confusing and did not make sense for the information I was trying to convey. I found that it may be best used for something that has time included in the data. I gained experience and practice with dplyr and patchwork! I feel more comfortable understanding how dplyr filtering works and creating a graph from it. It was also helpful learning how to wrangle this data to figure out what I wanted to show. I learned how to make the text larger of the title, axis, and axis ticks! It was interesting to learn all of the ways I could customize the graph.
